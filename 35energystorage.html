  ### 35 Ways to Store Energy

  

  Gasoline in a car
Biodiesel - produced from vegetable and animal fats
Combustible hydrogen in a car
Hydrogen fuel cell
Hydrogen fusion – combination of 2 hydrogen atoms into helium will release energy
Compressed air
Lithium-ion battery
Iron-air battery
Redox flow battery
Zinc-carbon dry cell
Alkaline battery
Lead-acid battery
Nickel-metal hydride battery
Flywheel
Capacitor
Pumped hydro
Food (contains calories that can be transformed into useful chemical energy)
Lipids (types of cells in the body that store energy)
Ice storage - freeze water at night, then melt and circulate for cooling
Molten salt thermal storage
Paraffin wax - phase change stores/releases energy
Salt hydrates - phase change stores/releases energy
Fatty acids - phase changes stores/releases energy
Pendulum at height h holding potential energy
Compressed/stretched spring
Pumped heat electrical storage
Black hole (stores electrical charge)
Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) – electrical charge runs through wire with practically 0 resistance
Nuclear fission: Uranium, Plutonium, Thorium – store energy before decaying, where neutrons split
Electromagnetic potential – i.e. hold 2 ferromagnets apart
Shoot a laser into a gravitational lens such that it returns years later, and can then be collected using something like a PV array
Satellite in orbit holds potential energy as it’s constantly falling – releases energy when it comes out of orbit back down to earth
Hand-warmers, where exothermic reaction releases heat
Chemical potential – holding 2 ions of opposite charge apart from each other
Chemical potential – hold a high concentration of an ion (i.e. potassium) on one side of a membrane
