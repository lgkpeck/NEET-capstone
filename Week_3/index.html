  ### Conflicting Variables and Resolution

  <strong>Engineering Variables:</strong>
  <br>Time to heat molten salt brick
  <br>Insulation material
  <br>Insulation thickness
  <br>Removability of insulation
  <br>Surface area of brick
  <br>Volume of brick
  <br>Type of salt
  <br>Initial temperature of molten salt brick
  <br>Duration of molten salt brick as heating source
  <br>Cost of insulation
  <br>Cost of brick
  <br>Surface temperature of brick

  Currently, the most difficult conflict of variables relates to the material placed around the molten salt brick. Insulation around the brick will enable easier transport of the brick, and it will also prevent heat loss from the brick during transportation. However, this insulation may also result in a low enough surface temperature such that the brick surrounded by insulation provides insufficient heating for the home. Furthermore, it will take longer to heat a brick surrounded by insulation. One resolution to this conflict may be to develop removable insulation for the brick. Insulation can be added for transport, but removed once the brick is placed in a ger's stove. 

  <strong>Progress this week:</strong>
  <br>Began development of a heat transfer model in Mathematica
  <br>Reached out to DMSE to gain access to thermocouples and lab space

  <strong>Pain point:</strong> No intuitive sense of what assumptions to make for model
  <br><strong>Resolution:</strong> Will start as basic as possible, and adding in complexity
  
  <strong>Pain point:</strong> Fuzzy understanding of properties of molten salt chemistry
  <br><strong>Resolution:</strong> Literature search and review of similar chemistries

  <strong>Pain point:</strong> Difficulty using XBee sensors
  <br><strong>Resolution:</strong> Borrow thermocouples and readers from DMSE

  <strong>Action items for this week:</strong>
  <br>Finish simple form of heat transfer model
  <br>Model impact of insulation around brick
  <br>Literature review of latent heat materials for surrounding brick
  <br>Heat up molten salt brick with furnace to get benchmark of time for experiments
  <br>Develop outline for midterm design review
