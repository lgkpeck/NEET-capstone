  ### Document Key Features and Drawbacks

  <strong>How should we document our design?</strong>
 
 We will document our design in 4 different ways. First, these design notebooks should demonstrate the design process throughout the semester. Next, we are creating a final video describing and pitching our design. We will pair this final video with a design review presentation for our partners at National University of Mongolia. Finally, we will create a technical design review document that will be added to the class website. Of these 4 types of documentation, I am most focused on the desing review report. I want to address roughly 4 aspects of the design. 

 <br>1) Material properties of the solar salt used, including calculations of volume of solar salt needed
 <br>2) Discussion of shape and materials of brick, ideally with COMSOL modelling of brick temperature over time
 <br>3) Description of insulation box created, including modelling of how insulation thickness will impact the temperature of the brick
 <br>4) Overview of heating, transportation, and handling of the molten salt brick

   <strong>What visuals can we use to pitch it to stakeholders?</strong>

  I think modelling visuals in COMSOL and Fusion can help show the thermal profile of the brick. Additionally, results from our multiple experimental runs should corroborate the models we're developing.

  <strong>Progress this week:</strong>
  <br>Added features to Mathematica modelling
  <br>Met with postdoc to inquire about thermal modelling
  <br>Downloaded COMSOL


  <strong>Pain point:</strong> Steep learning curve for learning COMSOL
  <br><strong>Resolution:</strong> Commit time to developing simple model before end of semester

  <strong>Action items this week:</strong>
  <br>Import Mathematica model into Github
  <br>Learn basic features of COMSOL
