  ### Energy Journey Storyboarding

  <strong>Who is likely to see immediate benefit from wide-spread implementation of your solution, without significant negative drawbacks? How can you enlist them to campaign locally in favor of implementing your creations?</strong>

  Molten salt bricks as thermal energy storage should offer immediate benefit to familes who now use coal and live in ger districts nearer the center of Ulaanbaatar. If our design works as expected, the bricks will provide the same heat that coal does now without similar levels of pollution. With government funding, we could pay residents of ger districts to demonstrate and discuss the molten salt brick as a heating solution with their neighbors. 

  <strong>Who is only likely to see benefits from wide-spread implementation of your solution after some negative consequences, such as financial investment, changing one's way of life, or changing vocation? How could you modify your overall design (and not just the physical things) to get them to go along with your ideas?</strong>

  The molten salt bricks may provide less utility to residences farther from the center Ulaanbaatar. It may be difficult to transport the heated bricks directly to households in ger districts with less infrastructure. There will likely also be many residents that are accustomed to adding coal to the stove for cooking, more heat, etc. Finally, those who currently sell and deliver coal may need to change their vocation. Our hope is that the existing infrastructure for coal can stay intact. Those who sell and deliver coal can transition to selling and delivering molten salt bricks. 

  <strong>Who is likely to see significant negative consequences of disrupting the energetic status quo? What can you do to ensure they are part of your solution, that they share in its benefits, and that they ultimately become allies to your cause?</strong>

  The coal industry in Mongolia is likely to see loss in profits if ger districts transition away from using coal. However, our current plan uses waste heat from coal power plants to heat molten salt bricks. Theoretically, the coal plant could make up lost profits by charging for waste heat. Furthermore, the coal industry can stand to benefit from energy transition if it helps manufacture/sell molten salt bricks.

  <strong>How will you address those disillusioned by previously floated and failed ideas to solve the same challenge, who may not be as readily receptive to hearing what you're working on?</strong>

  There may be ger residents who have (justified) concerns about using yet another new form of heating. I believe the best way to build trust in new technology is by partnering with ger residents that are willing to test out molten salt bricks in their home. Hopefully, we can leverage community relationships to gradually build trust. 

  <strong>Progress this week:</strong>
  <br>Ran our 3rd thermal experiment
  <br>Reviewed Autodesk Fusion thermal modelling

  <strong>Pain point:</strong> Experimental solar salt mixture may have decomposed at temperatures above 560Â°C
  <br><strong>Resolution:</strong> Melt mixture being used in experiment as well as new solar salt mixture. Compare color, Tm to assess whether they still have the same properties.
  
  <strong>Pain point:</strong> Cooling curve for molten salt brick shows no plateau, which might be expected during phase change
  <br><strong>Resolution:</strong> Use additional thermal sensors in/around the brick to measure a possible temperature gradient in liquid during solidifcation

  <strong>Pain point:</strong> Inadequate estimate of how much power/energy is needed to heat the ger, given that smoke would not need to be diverted out
  <br><strong>Resolution:</strong> Review energy use of electrice heating solutions in gers

  <strong>Action items for this week:</strong>
  <br>Clean up Mathematica model and import into class site
  <br>Conduct Experiment 4 using fresh solar salt
  <br>Build basic Fusion model
  <br>Organize website
